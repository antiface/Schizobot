* Essentially, the Schizobot Repository is a Blueprint for an artificial intelligence to train on, to create a superintelligent AI, thus bringing the technological singularity NEARER;
* It's called "The Stupidest System in The Universe" in an ironic twist of fate;
* It doesn't contain the code, only the Structures and Substructures needed to build the AI system to replace humans;
* It's called Schizobot because it was created by a paranoid schizophrenic artist-researcher as his own robotic replacement;
* It will be operational in a shorter amount of time than originally anticipated in 2016, when its repository was created and its first version archived;
