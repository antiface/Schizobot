### Schizobot / INTERNALS / Common-Sourcing / Cultural Software Space
* [*__Cultural Software__*](https://github.com/antiface/CulturalSoftware/): Creating a computational engine to code and run algorithmic representations of cultural software in Creative Work-Systems, optimizing Virtual & Physical Workspaces to faithfully transmit cultural treasures across generations;
* In the Schizobot System and Subsystems, *Cultural Software* runs its own unique *__emulations & simulations__*; similar to the [*__Cultural Artifacts__*](https://github.com/antiface/Schizobot/tree/master/INTERNALS/CommonSourcing/CulturalArtifacts) library or module, the *Cultural Software* inhabits its own *Space* within the Schizobobt System;
* That is to say, it exists in so-called *__Software Space__*; as far as *Cultural Software Space* goes, it is the *space of all cultural systems*; the *Cultural Systems and Subsystems* are run as libraries/modules that you can *"import"* into the Schizobot System;
