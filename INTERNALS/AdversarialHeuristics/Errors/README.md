* Type errors:
   * In the decision making process, when faced with uncertainty, a subject can make two possible errors: type I or type II.
   * A type I error is a false positive, thinking that an effect is there, when it is not. For example, acting on a fire alarm that turns out to be false. When someone infers sexual interest, where there is none, then a false-positive error has occurred.;
   * A type II error is a false negative, not seeing an effect where one exists. Ignoring the fire alarm that turns out to be accurate, due to scepticism, illustrates this point. Falsely inferring a lack of intent about sexual interest means a false negative error has occurred.;

* "An influential theory in the recent evolutionary psychology literature is error management
theory (Haselton, 2007; Haselton et al., 2009; Haselton and Buss, 2000,
2003; Haselton and Nettle, 2006). Proponents of error management theory argue
that biologically evolved systems of decision and judgment reveal a general engineering
principle. Namely, when one type of error is consistently more costly
than others, behavior that suppresses the rate at which individuals commit the more
costly error will be favored." - Ref. The Subtleties of Error Management by Ryan McKay and Charles Efferson;
