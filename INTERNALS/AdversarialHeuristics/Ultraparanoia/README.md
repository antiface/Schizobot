### Schizobot / INTERNALS / Adversarial Heuristics / Ultraparanoia
* In theory, you are in a situation which is the very worst of all possible worst-case scenarios;
* You are taken there suddenly; You weren't prepared; the Ultimate Paranoid Delusion is real/true;
* All your worst fears are realized in an instant; Reality just falls apart, completely fragmented/fissured;
* Formally studying ultraparanoia from the perspective of everyday life, and social and organizational contexts too;
* SEE: Ultra paranoid computing;
* Possessed by ubiquitous, extremely catastrophic thinking;
* Being "paranoid about the paranoia";
* Continuously assessing threats and thinking up worst-case scenarios about everything;
* When leaving the house to do groceries is a massively complex logistical problem with no optimal solution;
* Often there no optimal solution, or else it's impossible, or not feasible, to find one;
* Being a natural-born disaster-recovery expert; Has plans for almost any kind of potential threat one can think of;
* "Everyone is potentially under opposition control."; ([Moscow Rules](https://redteams.net/redteaming/2013/the-moscow-rules));

* [THREAT MODEL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model):
  * Threat modeling is a process by which potential threats, such as structural vulnerabilities or the absence of appropriate safeguards, can be identified, enumerated, and mitigations can be prioritized. The purpose of threat modeling is to provide defenders with a systematic analysis of what controls or defenses need to be included, given the nature of the system, the probable attacker’s profile, the most likely attack vectors, and the assets most desired by an attacker. Threat modeling answers questions like “Where am I most vulnerable to attack?”, “What are the most relevant threats?”, and “What do I need to do to safeguard against these threats?”.
  * Conceptually, most people incorporate some form of threat modeling in their daily life and don’t even realize it. Commuters use threat modeling to consider what might go wrong during the morning drive to work and to take preemptive action to avoid possible accidents. Children engage in threat modeling when determining the best path toward an intended goal while avoiding the playground bully. In a more formal sense, threat modeling has been used to prioritize military defensive preparations since antiquity.
