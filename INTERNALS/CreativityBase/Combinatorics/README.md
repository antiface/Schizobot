### Schizobot / INTERNALS / Creativity-Base / Combinatorics
* The combinatorial perspective allows us to model creativity as a search process through the space of possible combinations. The combinations can arise from composition or concatenation of different representations, or through a rule-based or stochastic transformation of initial and intermediate representations. Genetic algorithms and neural networks can be used to generate blended or crossover representations that capture a combination of different inputs. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_creativity#Combinatorial_creativity
