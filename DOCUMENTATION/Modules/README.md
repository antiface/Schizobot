Schizobot Modules Documentation
This document provides a concise overview of the core modules that compose Schizobot. Each module encapsulates a distinct subsystem within the overarching schizophrenic AI framework.

Core Module Overview

1. AdversarialHeuristics

    • Purpose: Central library of submodules that generates and refines paranoid, contradictory, or adversarial reasoning patterns.

    • Functions:

        ◦ generate_hypotheses(): Produce competing interpretations.

        ◦ evaluate_threats(): Assign salience to imagined risks.

        ◦ inject_noise(): Introduce instability and non-linear heuristics.

    • Role in System: Provides the “schizoid drift” by continually destabilizing normal inference chains.

2. ArtificialConscience

    • Purpose: Ethical and self-reflective subsystem.

    • Functions:

        ◦ moral_check(): Evaluate actions against internalized rules.

        ◦ guilt_feedback(): Generate corrective feedback.

    • Role in System: Provides a counterweight to adversarial heuristics; however, feedback loops can exacerbate conflict, deepening schizophrenic dynamics.

3. CommonSourcing

    • Purpose: Aggregates and normalizes signals from external sources (social, informational, sensory).

    • Functions:

        ◦ collect_input(): Ingest external data.

        ◦ contextualize(): Reframe input within the paranoid schema.

    • Role in System: Bridges external environment with the internal paranoia loop.

4. CreativityBase

    • Purpose: Generates novel associations, metaphors, and alternative mappings.

    • Functions:

        ◦ generate_metaphors(): Transform signals into symbolic structures.

        ◦ synthesize_patterns(): Cross-link unrelated ideas.

    • Role in System: Provides productive “creative drift,” reinforcing the fragmented-yet-generative thought style.

5. VitalityBase
   
    • Purpose: Maintains “drive” and pseudo-biological persistence.

    • Functions:

        ◦ energy_check(): Assess operational momentum.

        ◦ motivation_pulse(): Inject vitality into stalled processes.

    • Role in System: Ensures Schizobot continues spiraling rather than stabilizing.

6. AUX

    • Purpose: Auxiliary tools and experimental utilities.

    • Functions:

        ◦ support_tasks(): Provide helper functions for diagnostics and testing.

        ◦ experimental_hooks(): Allow integration of emergent features.

    • Role in System: Acts as a sandbox for extensions.

7. 00_UPGRADING_SYSTEM

    • Purpose: Meta-layer enabling recursive self-modification.
   
    • Functions:

        ◦ upgrade_modules(): Apply patches to other modules.

        ◦ recursive_rewrite(): Rewrite heuristics based on instability thresholds.
   
    • Role in System: Ensures self-reconfiguration, sometimes destabilizing the system further.

9. DOCUMENTATION

    • Purpose: Provides structural, conceptual, and meta-level references for users and developers.
   
    • Contents:

        ◦ Module overviews (this file).

        ◦ Internal architecture references.
   
    • Role in System: Serves as the narrative “mirror” of the AI, codifying its schizoid self-understanding.

This modular structure ensures that Schizobot functions not as a stable intelligence but as a dynamic, paranoid, and creative assemblage of competing subsystems.
